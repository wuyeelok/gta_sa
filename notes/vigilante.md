## Starting at the Panopticon

![Panopticon Location Image](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/7/76/ThePanopticon-GTASA-RedCountyMap.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190215063748 "Panopticon Location")

If doing the mission early on (for example in order to create a 'master save file' right at the start of the game where such gamey methods as a tank or gunship helo aren't available [see below]) it may be beneficial to start the mission in the Panopticon area (far northwest of the first legally accessible island). Starting the mission here will generally cause the targets to spawn on the road that goes around the Panopticon hill or the general area. Having them spawn around the hill is beneficial as you can take shortcuts over the hill in some instances and can then ambush the targets with the weapon of your choice, say an RPG (one RPG spawn point is on top of a building near the fire station in LS. An airplane is required to get to it though as no helicopters spawn on the LS island in the beginning).

Starting here has the added benefit of less traffic (and no fast highway traffic) in addition to a lower police presence, making it possible to finish all 12 levels without attracting more than two wanted stars (having less innocent bystanders around influence this too).

Possible glitches when starting the mission here is that the targets may spawn on the bridge that leads to the LV island from Blueberry acres. Should this glitch occur, one can only hope that they spawn heading towards the LS side, otherwise it would be best to pick off the targets with an RPG or sniper rifle (the target vehicle(s) are stopped by the blocked bridge ends at either end).

## Glitch

There is a glitch in the game which makes vigilante missions extremely easy to complete: simply get a police car (general consensus is that it MUST be a police CAR, but some people report a police bike working) and activate the mission. Next, go into a fast food restaurant or bar and walk around until the message comes up that the criminals have been terminated. Go back into your police car to start the next level and then repeat the process. This also sometimes works when visiting a clothing store or a 24/7.

I've found that doing this glitch in Los Santos doesn't work well, because the baddies are often spawned in rural areas which the cops don't get to quickly enough.

The trick is to wait until you're in San Fiero, and start the glitch near the north end of the city, just south of the bridge, like at the Pizza joint there. All the baddies spawn downtown, and the cops get to them rather quickly.
