# Overview

Get in an ambulance and start the mission. Pick up the patients (up to three at a time) and bring them back to the nearest hospital.

Level 1 has one patient and each successive level has one more patient, up to level 12. This means it takes 78 successful pickups to complete the mission.

This is easier than Los Santos, and you can do this run even if you haven't unlocked San Fierro. Start in the small town called Montgomery located west of the northern highway that leads out of Los Santos. The hospital is on the western edge of town.

For the first few levels, all the patients will be in Montgomery. Further along, you will have patients to pick up in Palamino Creek (to the east), Hampton Barns (to the west), and Dillimore (southwest). The further away the patients, the more time bonus you get for picking them up. All the driving between towns is on two-lane highways.
